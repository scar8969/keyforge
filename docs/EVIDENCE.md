# Evidence

Every claim below comes from a command that was actually run against this
exact checkout. Nothing here is inferred from the source alone.

## Commands

```sh
# from the project directory, with _tools and _tools/_vendor on PYTHONPATH
python -m pytest -q -p hosttmp_proj tests/
python -m compileall -q src
```

## HTTP surface

One real GET per rule in the assembled URL map, through Flask's test
client. `ok` includes 404 on a templated path: an empty database has
no such resource, and 404 is the honest answer for that.

## What this file does not claim

- No browser screenshot: this host denies the Chromium sandbox the renderer
  needs, so the HTTP surface is evidenced with recorded status codes instead.
- No network access: the suite is hermetic and contacts no remote host.
- No container run: the Dockerfile is reviewed, not executed, because no
  container runtime is reachable from this host.
